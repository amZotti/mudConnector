This is a MUD server that has been built on Rails. Traditionally all MUDs are made in a derivative of C or C++ and use telnet.
I wanted to make a MUD on a Rails server and use Websockets as the protocol instead. My motivation for doing this comes
partly from my eagerness to learn, and partly because I love MUDs and see them as a great way to learn while having fun.

My hope is that I can continue further projects like this and play a role in revitalizing the text-based gaming community.
